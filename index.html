        <h1>WELCOME TO MY BLOG</h1>

            <p>My name is Jeremy Rivers, I am a fisherman fanatic and aspiring reporter living in Joburg. The city of gold holds a 
            special place in my heart due to its diverse culture and rich history. It took me a good while to become familiar with my
            new life in the city. Before moving here, I lived on a small farm in the Free state, where I was born and raised. There I
            went to school with a handful of really good friends. During my early life, my father would always take me on fishing
            trips where we would catch a ton of fish. I was always curious to find out which bait attracts the biggest fish and why.
            At the age of 13, our family moved to Johannesburg to look for better opportunities. I would lie if I said high school
            treated me well. The most important thing I learned is to stand up for myself and the ones I love. Many of us living
            in the city know exactly how demanding life circumstances can be. At first, I was bothered by all the noise and
            frustrated people.  But in the last 5 years, I’ve grown to embrace the chaos and find my own path that leads to a
            brighter future. Now 25 years old, I have come to realize that my love for fishing also sparked an interest in
            narrative pleasure. People consume stories that are significant to their surrounding environment or social
            interests. Much like fish, every person can be baited and hooked onto a story if it interests them. I will
            use this website to produce my own coverage of real events that impacts our lives and gives shape to our society.
