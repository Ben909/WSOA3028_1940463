<h2> <font size = "6">Internet Histories</font> 

</h2>
<p>

    Before the internet came into fruition, it was difficult to amass and store information in such a way that it could provide easy access to multiple interrelated subjects.
    It wasn’t until 15 years after the first computers were built that researchers conceptualized a network of interconnected computers that provides services which transcends the capabilities of a single system [1].
    This system ultimately forms the foundation of a new platform which encapsulates the history and future of all known research.
    The internet as we know it today, relates to the gathering of information throughout history.
    It continuously expands through the collection of data which enables humans to better understand the world around them.
    As a result, the Internet has become an amalgamation of libraries that entails the history of humankind.
    As Borges suggests, “the first librarians, employed a language quite different from the one we speak today.”[2].
    This relates to the idea that the internet constantly changes and adapts to the needs of its users.
    It would be difficult to imagine a world without the internet since it provides us with instant access to information on countless interrelated subjects that are available in various languages.
    What makes it even more accessible is the ability to communicate and share information on a global scale.
    It enables people to rapidly collect data and extend the knowledge which is already available. 
    The internet is now regarded to be a major force in the way society views and accesses information.

<h3> <font size = "6">Important Moment in Internet Development</font> 

</h3>
<p>

    Since it first came into our lives, the internet has revolutionized the way we live and communicate.
    Up until the year 2004, people used Hotmail and Yahoo to send and receive digital information.
    These two email providers offered between 2 MB and 4 MB of storage space. 
    So, when google launched its own free online service, they announced users would be provided with 1 GB storage space.[3] 
    This far exceeded the normal capacity of any other e-mail service at the time. 
    It meant that businesses could operate more efficiently and that they could keep track of the communication that took place between employees and other businesses. 
    It also supported an advertising webmail system which quickly became popular amongst most manufacturers. 
    This allows businesses to rapidly expand their connections with people around the world. 
    These advertisements have caused disaster in the majority of user inboxes. 
    It’s also the main cause of what is known as “email overload”[4] which relates to having emails with various status types. 
    Overload also suggest an excessive volume of incoming email about topics which are unrelated to its users. 
    Furthermore, personal user information could be accessed which caused further overload of spam mail. 
    One aspect that made G-mail more viable was its interconnectivity with other applications associated with google. 
    Establishing such links made any interrelated software more popular with users around the world.

<h4> <font size = "6">What is a Browser?</font> 

</h4>
<p>

    A browser can be seen as a source of information or code used by computers to translate various texts and other graphical features. 
    They are designed to be user friendly and provide us with the capability to meaningfully interact with information on webpages. 
    The quality of browsers are often measured in how quickly they respond to user inputs and how smooth interactions take place [5]. 
    The basic functionality of any browser includes the website’s URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which will identify a specific webpage. 
    For example, https://www.protuts.com/. Next the browser requests the desired page information from an external server. 
    The browser then receives a file containing the HTML language and Javascript code which uses instructions to display information. 
    Users are then able to interact with the pages that are displayed. This entire process takes place in a matter of seconds. 
    The WorldWideWeb became the first web browser with the basic functionality to view online web pages. 
    Its creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee launched the project in the year 1990 [6]. 
    With its release, a foundation was formed that led to the immersive online experience users have today. 
    The current stream of social media, research and commerce are only available because of internet browsers. 
    We have become so accustomed with internet services that we cannot imagine life without it.

<h5> <font size = "6">Accessibility</font> 

</h5>
<p>

    The importance of accessibility cannot be underestimated when it comes internet browsing. 
    The majority of people will shy away from webpages which lack the aesthetic qualities to enhance user experience. 
    An all-inclusive webpage caters for the need of an entire audience, even people with disabilities. 
    Once an individual is comfortable with a website, it is likely that they will develop an expectation for other websites to be of the same quality they have previously experienced. 
    Accessibility ranges anywhere from being able to magnify images for elderly people to providing alternative communication to people with cognitive disabilities. 
    Businesses rely heavily on the use of easy access to information to optimize how they operate and interact with each other. 
    Studies has also shown that a more accessible website will attract larger audiences, require less maintenance cost and achieve better search results [7]. 
    Successful accessibility stems from several components working in tandem. 
    Web content refers any information that is made available by the website, for example images, texts, scripts, code, etc. 
    User agents looks at the software people can use to access web content, for example voice browsers or mobile phone browsers. 
    The final component involves authoring tools which enables people create their own web content. 
    This includes the various code editors, blogs and document conversion tools.

<h6> <font size = "6">The Medium is the Message</font> 

</h6>
<p>

    Throughout the ages, we have always developed new ways to communicate information effectively across emerging platforms.
    Each medium is improved or built upon the characteristics of previous successful platforms.
    As a new medium comes into fruition, we become aware of the advantages and disadvantages or at least how it can change the way we normally do things.
    There are often unsuspected consequences in new technologies that implicate our society and culture.
    In these sudden changes, it is important to understand the extent to which technology alters our perception of messages and their meanings.
    Therefore, it can be argued that the message which results from the medium may be used to change the attitude of an audience and encourage them to take action.
    The technological advancements make it easy for multiple interactions to take place between communicative devices.
    Marshal McLuhan is of the opinion that the manner in which we send and receive information is more important than the contents of the information itself.
    Nowadays we are able to produce our own content based on the technology that we consume, for example, the contents of a television program can be shared or discussed anywhere around the world through social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook.
    It is evident that technology has and will continuously change the way we understand and interpret information.
    To a certain extent the ‘medium’ reorganizes our consciousness and how we consume messages, thus changing they way we view society itself.

<h7> <font size = "6"><strong>Hypertext, Navigation and Structure</strong></font> 

</h7>

<p>
    Hypertext is used as a form of navigation that grants any reader access to information that links to specific topics.
    The hypertext is usually displayed on computer screens with some form of styling that enables users to identify them.
    For example, dynamic hypertext changes in response to user input while stretch hypertext gives more control over the contents and level of detail displayed within a document.
    We use this electronic text format to create interconnections between audio, videos and graphics, thereby establishing navigation routes in the form of hyperlinks.
    It is one of the most reliable methods used to facilitate human communication around the world.
    Without hypertext, we would be unable to effectively use the internet as a channel to distribute communication to the masses. 
    The importance of effective navigation on web pages cannot be underestimated, as it allows users to become familiar with the layout of a website and how it operates.
    Most people enjoy their online experiences because they feel comfortable navigating websites that follow a logical structure.
    Developers make use of maps to guide users and ease the cognitive load of navigation that is caused by poor web structure.
    These maps also provide helpful information to any relevant connections between concepts which could broaden the user’s knowledge.

<h8> <font size = "6"><strong>Metaphor Design for User Interface</strong></font> 

</h8>

<p>
    An interface metaphor is a set of user interface visuals, actions and procedures that exploit specific knowledge that users have previously gained from other websites.
    The purpose of the interface metaphor is to give the user knowledge in a simplistic format about how to interact with the user interface.
    They are designed to be similar to our own physical entities but also contain their own properties, for example, desktop metaphors and web portals.
    They can be based on an activity and object or a combination of both work with user’s knowledge to help them understand the unfamiliar.
    Examples of interface metaphors are the magnifying glasses that represent the “zoom in” function or folder icons to show where files are contained.
    These are used in most current operating systems; however, this technology is susceptible to change as computers become more advanced.
    A down side to changing interface metaphors on a constant basis is that the owners of software with many users are reluctant to make big changes and their interfaces evolve permanently to keep their familiar look and familiarity.
    Software designers attempt to make applications easier to use for both novice and adept users by creating concrete metaphors that resemble the user’s real-world experiences.
    Continual technological improvement has made metaphors depict these real-world experiences more realistically to ultimately enhance interface performance.
