        <h1>Twitter post</h1>

        <p>Twitter user Gretchen McCulloch claims, “Every so often, you end up down a Wikipedia rabbit hole that reminds you how 
            Wikipedia’s editorship being male create huge content gaps for certain topics, especially those more typically associated 
            with woman.” This is a very interesting statement that I am sure not many people are aware of. Most people do know that 
            Wikipedia is a software that hosts collaborative projects and creates an encyclopedia of almost every concept in existence. 
            The word ‘Wiki’ is Hawaiian for ‘quick’ and corresponds to how easily information can be accessed by users globally. 
            The legitimacy of source material found on Wikipedia is always in question since its information can be produced and published
            by anyone in the world. For this reason, Wikipedia is filled with gaps of uncertainty about the content that it presents.
            Especially when male writers contribute to subject matters that may be better examined from a female perspective. I believe
            McColloch’s tweet emphasizes that we must be conscious and warry of Wikipedia content and the way it conducts and provides 
            research. To counter this, Wikipedia provides additional links to external websites and resources that can be used to further 
            expand on related topics..</p>
