        <h1>What is a Browser?</h1>

        <p> A browser can be seen as a source of information or code used by computers to translate various texts and other graphical features. 
            They are designed to be user friendly and provide us with the capability to meaningfully interact with information on webpages. 
            The quality of browsers are often measured in how quickly they respond to user inputs and how smooth interactions take place. 
            The basic functionality of any browser includes the website’s URL (Uniform Resource Locator), which will identify a specific webpage. 
            For example, https://www.protuts.com/. Next the browser requests the desired page information from an external server. 
            The browser then receives a file containing the HTML language and Javascript code which uses instructions to display information. 
            Users are then able to interact with the pages that are displayed. This entire process takes place in a matter of seconds. 
        </p>    
        <p> The WorldWideWeb became the first web browser with the basic functionality to view online web pages. 
            Its creator, Sir Tim Berners-Lee launched the project in the year 1990 (Grauschopf.2019). 
            With its release, a foundation was formed that led to the immersive online experience users have today. 
            The current stream of social media, research and commerce are only available because of internet browsers. 
            We have become so accustomed with internet services that we cannot imagine life without it.
