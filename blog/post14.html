        <h1>Criminal Machine Learning</h1>

        <p> The criminal justice system has always stood on the foundation where people, regardless of their identities, are treated equally
            by the law. But in many cases, we manipulate the accuracy of this system through our own past experiences and biased 
            expectations of others. In the early 19th century the criminologist Cesare Lombroso became interested in the notion that our 
            physical features deeply reflect our moral character traits. In his view, criminals are revealed in their physiognomy and we 
            can therefore detect them by looking at pictures of their faces. This notion was debunked at the time, since it relied heavily
            on conventional racism whereby criminals were represented as subhuman or primitive savages. Lombroso’s work influenced the 
            later 2016 studies of Xialoin Wu and Xi Zhang who claimed that they have developed and researched an algorithm that could 
            distinguish criminals simply by scanning a photograph of their face. Their study reads, “Unlike a human examiner/judge, a 
            computer vision algorithm or classifier has absolutely no subjective baggages, having no emotions, no biases whatsoever due 
            to past experience, race, religion, political doctrine, gender, age, etc., no mental fatigue, no preconditioning of a bad 
            sleep or meal. The automated inference on criminality eliminates the variable of meta-accuracy (the competence of the human 
            judge/examiner) all together.” Wu & Zhang (2017). The training data comes from us humans who predominantly rely on appearances
            when convicting criminals. Their claim, however, is widely believed to be “bullshit” since the algorithm is going to be every
            bit as biased as the training data that was used to create it. People are naturally biased about appearances when they 
            convict. Less attractive people are more likely to be convicted for crimes. The training data from this so-called unbiased
            algorithm isn’t actually picking up criminality. Instead it picks up attractiveness based on facial structure while neglecting facial expressions.
