        <h1>Toward a study of information geographies</h1>

        <p> A close inspection of the concept ‘’information geography’’ reveals that the source and authenticity of information is
            mediated through networks that exist as separate entities. The research is mobile in the sense that it comes from a 
            specific area and evolves based on the development of infrastructure. Technology provides the means to drastically 
            increase the depth of information gathering and dissemination. This gives us the ability to produce large-scale data 
            collection structures that expands our overall encyclopedic reach. 
        </p>    
        <p> The twentieth century stands as a testament to the 
            success and influence that internet technologies has on society. In most countries, digital engagement is dependent on
            the accessibility of internet to communicate information effectively across various platforms. The number of users
            worldwide is influenced by the factor of affordability as service quality differs from one place to another.
            For example, Asia alone holds 42% of the world’s internet population. This is more than the combined number of
            users across Europa and North America. African countries support less users due to economic conditions such as a
            lower rate of income. There are of course other reasons that influence the level of internet participation around
            the world. The distribution of collaborative coding hosted by platforms such as GitHub enables publishers to 
            expand and share projects with each other. Content producers are dependent on GitHub services to host websites 
            or track changes across projects.
