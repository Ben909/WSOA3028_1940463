        <h1>Robots in Digital Spaces</h1>

        <p> In the digital world robots or ‘bots’ are scripted software programs that are designed to do repetitive automated tasks. Bots have 
            been around since the beginning of the internet with a purpose to harvest and store information. They are equipped with sensors 
            that detect certain kinds of information in a manner that far exceeds human capabilities. Online search engines use bots to Fulfil 
            our needs and grant instant access to information that we would otherwise take much longer to find ourselves. These bots have 
            come a long way and are being developed for multiple purposes. Applications like Siri for example, are digital assistants that 
            learn and memorize human interactions to help facilitate our day to day lives.
        </p>   
        <p> There are also a number of malicious bot that cause
            major harm to websites and account users. Known to some extent as trojans, these bots endlessly searches through websites for 
            traces of personal information like e-mail addresses that are then used for spam mail.  Even clicking on certain online links can 
            trigger bots to search and collect information stored on digital devices. The most common type of bot is a web crawler or a web 
            spider. These bots can be collectively be programmed to be used as cyber weapons. Once coordinated to the same webpage, the 
            unexpected request volume can overwhelm the webserver and cause it to crash, losing valuable information in the process. This is 
            known as a ddos attack or distributed denial of service attack. Websites are specifically developed to prevent bots from gaining 
            access to their servers. To safeguard their websites and account information, developers have created the captcha. It requires the 
            user to fill out a random series of numbers, letters or images before allowing entry into the site. The sole purpose of this
            design is to keep bots out of the website so that no harm can be done to its users. 
        </p>    
        <p> Since their initial design, bots have become 
            smarter and easier to make as open source databases like GitHub grants access to coded software for any individual needs. Social 
            bots have begun to appear more frequently on sites like Twitter, Facebook and Reddit which is a major cause for concern. This is 
            because bots can already be programmed to learn from material they find on the web. Often times this means bots behave in ways that
            programmers did not anticipate or intend. Questions of who is responsible for this unpredictable behavior are therefore made more 
            complicated. We must carefully consider the interactions bots may have in the near future.
