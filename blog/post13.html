        <h1>Alternative approaches to interface technologies.</h1>

        <p> The technologies that we use in our daily lives usually require some conventional form of user input that would allow 
            them to gain access to digital services. When we study alternative interface technologies, our goal is to break the normal
            convention of user interactivity. So instead of the normal mouse and keyboard devices, we look into new ways technology 
            interacts and receives input commands that would allow the user to connect with a more dynamic technological environment. 
            But why is it necessary, what are the advantages? 
        </p>    
        <p> Well for starters, these complex systems provide us with the means to 
            experiment with abstract forms of communication with digital systems. Many traumatized patients would benefit greatly from 
            these inventions. Eye- tracking technology removes any form touch-based interactions from input systems. For the ill and 
            impaired, these types of technologies would provide endless satisfaction and benefits that would otherwise require human 
            participation.<a href="https://tinyurl.com/y88u3dek">Cybernetic</a>  for example, physically attaches mechanical construct to aid with various tasks. By connecting 
            with our electronic environment, we establish a connection of control whereby the machine guides and teaches us to 
            comprehend what we are truly capable of. Since we have already evolved past the ‘normal’ expectations of our predecessors,
            we might as well venture into the unknown to better understand our relationship with the technological environment. 
        </p>    
        <p> Stelarc was one of the first humans to receive cybernetic attachments to his body. By having these extensions, he became 
            alienated him from the general public due to the abstract nature of the system.” The invasiveness of Stelarc’s systems, 
            and by extension much work in cybernetic systems , is sustained by an overriding philosophical belief in the value of 
            intimately connecting humans with their machines” Perhaps the world is yet physically and mentally capable to endure the 
            stress of managing these kinds of technologies. However, Stelarc is not wrong by saying that we might have to depend on 
            this kind of technology in the future. In one way or another these systems surely push the boundaries of interface technologies.
