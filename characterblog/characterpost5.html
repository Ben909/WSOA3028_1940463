        <h2>Newspapers and Narratives</h2>

        <p> Since journalism is fundamentally based on the gathering of information from various sources, we expect newspapers to accurately
            present and acknowledge the stories that influence and shape our cultural surroundings. The content of a newspaper is 
            constructed and framed to entice readers and engage audiences in wider debates. This benefits publishers from a social and 
            financial perspective because audiences are able to interact with the content on a cultural level. Small newspapers or tabloids 
            present more condensed stories that are consumed by everyday readers. They have become more popular than broadsheet newspapers 
            due to the sensational nature of its content and how it implicates our daily lives. Newspapers monitor various cumulative 
            notions that circulates within society to determine how content will be presented for their audience. Publishers will abide by 
            the interests of their audience to ensure the production of rich and creative content. It is important to realize that tabloid 
            newspapers attract and communicate with readers in such a manner that wider cultural relations become the focus point of the 
            newspaper itself. Stories rely on critical debates between individuals of the public sphere to ensure a healthy democracy is 
            granted to all members of society. This cultural discourse according to Johansson (2007) “acknowledges that the sole importance 
            of news may not lie in its ability to convey information, but also in its structures, ways of creating meaning, and in its links 
            to social and cultural contexts.” The structure of news articles plays an integral role in the projection and communication of 
            narrative space, as experienced by the viewer. Newspapers provide a spatial awareness that enables viewers to contest and express 
            social inequalities that arise from the need to control power and other resources. In doing so, individuals gain a better 
            understanding of their social identity within society. The mediums we use to disseminate information helps to contextualise and 
            emphasizes the importance of culture as a vessel to construct knowledge within our society. Each story is created and influenced by 
            the presence of its spatial environment and how the narrator ascribes meaning to events. Today’s technology enables us to produce 
            and share content through interconnected platforms. This space provides newspapers with the capability to extend their source 
            material and grant audiences easy access to information. It also enables audiences to interact with each other through the mediums 
            that are provided. For example, online websites are equipped with comment sections that enable audiences to communicate and discuss 
            the contents of an article. There are additional links to external websites in case readers feel the urge to further explore other related topics.
