        <h1>How we learn through Technology</h1>

        <p> In our current age, computation is moving to what’s called a pervasive world where interaction takes place all around us.  
            We have grown accustomed to the ways that technology interacts and shapes our cultural beliefs within society. In the 
            twenty-first century, the human mind has adopted new sensory capabilities to accommodate the increased amount of information 
            that we need to process. This post will reflect how pervasive technologies enable users to engage with information through 
            augmented physical spaces. It is important for us to be conscious of how our interactions with each other and the environment 
            reinforces our learning experience. “Novel forms of interactions can be developed, that exploit the ‘physical’ and the ‘digital’ 
            in a diversity of ways that move beyond the desktop genre of interactions.” The emergence of digitally augmented physical spaces 
            promotes an active learning environment that engages how we process information. It is essential that these spaces accommodate our 
            youth and their capability to gain knowledge through mediated interactions.
        </p>    
        <p> According to Sara Price and Yvonne Rogers’ framework on 
            interaction in digitally augmented physical spaces, effective learning takes place once the human body and mind actively responds 
            to the discovery of new experiences in the world. We choose to incorporate technologies that engages our senses and motivates us to 
            reflect on meaningful interactions. It is essential that technology enables learners to expand the knowledge they already possess 
            and construct new levels of understanding how information can be perceived. This reconstructed form of knowledge is based on how 
            thoughts are exchanged through different types of experiential interactions. Additionally, social interaction and cultural 
            backgrounds play an integral role in how individuals construct knowledge for themselves.
