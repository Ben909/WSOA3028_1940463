        <h1>Hypertext, Navigation and Structure</h1>

        <p> Hypertext is used as a form of navigation that grants any reader access to information that links to specific topics.
            The hypertext is usually displayed on computer screens with some form of styling that enables users to identify them.
            For example, dynamic hypertext changes in response to user input while stretch hypertext gives more control over the contents and level of detail displayed within a document.
            We use this electronic text format to create interconnections between audio, videos and graphics, thereby establishing navigation routes in the form of hyperlinks.
            It is one of the most reliable methods used to facilitate human communication around the world.
            Without hypertext, we would be unable to effectively use the internet as a channel to distribute communication to the masses. 
        </p>    
        <p> The importance of effective navigation on web pages cannot be underestimated, as it allows users to become familiar with the layout of a website and how it operates.
            Most people enjoy their online experiences because they feel comfortable navigating websites that follow a logical structure.
            Developers make use of maps to guide users and ease the cognitive load of navigation that is caused by poor web structure.
            These maps also provide helpful information to any relevant connections between concepts which could broaden the userâ€™s knowledge.
