        <h1>Data driven Storytelling</h1>

        <p>As with many words, an applicable definition of the word ‘story’ varies between communities based on the expectations and 
            contextual evidence inherent to the exposition of these stories. Beyond the expression of ideas or events, the design 
            principals of stories provide a cognitive overview about how we digest information. The engagement audiences receive from how 
            stories are mediated offers a level of discourse in association with the type of story or genre. Therefore, data storytellers 
            use innovative technologies to make their stories more engaging by relating the information to specific demographics or shared datasets (REF).   
        </p>    
        <p> While the overarching principals of stories and data driven storytelling are the same, there is a difference in their manner 
            of execution. Graphics demand less guidance to how information is understood by the viewer. They are visually more inclined to 
            express the processes and behavioral patterns or ideas that require investigation. The interpretation of data sources reveals 
            stories that wouldn’t been found otherwise. Data driven stories are designed to empower us to find information that is relevant to 
            our community and individuality.
