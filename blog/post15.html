        <h1>Learning and Teaching Online</h1>

        <p> It has been just over 100 years since the deadly Spanish flu of 1918, now history is ready to challenges us again with an elusive 
            virus that questions our day to day activities. The effects of Covid-19 have gripped the world in unfathomable ways, forcing us to 
            adopt new methods of education and interaction across all fields. Consequently, our formal education has been reduced to an online 
            community where students are uncertain about their learning outcomes as well as the availability of data to access source material. 
            Initially, the majority of students did not possess the amounts of data required to attend live video calls at online platforms. 
            Many institutes realize that the economic divide limits accessibility to data for certain demographics. Various countermeasures 
            were evaluated and set in place to accommodate each individual and ensure the continuation of the academic curriculum.
        </p>    
        <p> Sadly, online learning is difficult to adopt and many students / staff fall victim to the medium itself. Being in an isolated learning 
            environment, it becomes difficult to effectively manage oneâ€™s own time according to the expectations that are needed. Leniency 
            with regard to workload and submissions are imperative to ensure students receive a fair change of passing their semester. A lack 
            of motivation often causes individuals to skip classes and spend less time interacting with their work and peers. E-learning lacks 
            the crucial element of temporal engagement, where students gain expertise from scenarios that require collaboration and problem 
            solving. We teach each other through the stories that we have experienced and learned from. In this manner, we gain a better 
            understanding of the skills required solve our biggest problems of today and tomorrow.
