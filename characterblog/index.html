    <h2>The State of load shedding</h2>
    <p>The climate this year feels different somehow, like 2020 is preparing us for a series of unexpected events. 
    This isn’t helped by the face that Eskom, South-Africa’s main electricity provider assures the country that stage 8 load 
    shedding is not expected, but planned for. Many of us wonder what other plans they have in store for us. The public was
    notified that each stage provides a reduction in load capacity of approximately 5%, meaning that each 5% equates to about 
    1000 megawatts. This news comes from a supposedly ‘inaccurate’ source that warns municipalities to brace for the escalation 
    of level 8 blackouts. Eskom maintains that it is highly unlikely that we will ever reach such a point, but experts disagree.
    Last year, the rolling blackouts occurred mainly because Eskom had depleted its resources and the power grid could no longer
    maintain its core functionality. This had a severe impact on small businesses, rural areas and the province of Cape Town.
    Thankfully Eskom received a financial injection form the government to ease the immense pressure on the power grid. Eskom
    maintains that the electrical system was under heavy strain from a series of rain storms in the Mpumalanga province. The
    disruption of coal supply had engineers working on a system that could decrease the risk of losing power units 
    unexpectedly. We anxiously await further details on the matter.</p>

        <h2>Covid-19 strikes the nation </h2>
        <p>Recent reports indicate the spreading of a deadly new virus that is ravaging countries all over the world. 
        The World Health Organization declared the virus is now a global pandemic and asks countries to take the necessary 
        precautions. This is due to the volatile nature of the airborne virus which enables it to spread rapidly between people.
         The virus originated in China’s Hubei province via the infected wet markets. These markets sell exotic animals for human 
         consumption due to China’s excessive population. Additional research conducted by American investigators suggests the 
         virus originated in one of China’s laboratories, but these theories were debunked. Furthermore, president Cyril Ramaphosa
          declared that South-Africa will enter a state of national lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading. Members of 
          society must wear face mask and practice social distancing while outside their houses. Thus far, there is no cure for 
          this particular coronavirus and according to researchers, it may take up to a year or longer to develop a vaccine. The 
          United States, Spain and Italy are among the hardest hit countries of the coronavirus. Patients with previous medical 
          conditions are at high risk of succumbing to the virus.</p>
