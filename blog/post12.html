        <h1>Web API’s</h1>

        <p> When it comes to technology, API is everywhere. Our daily usage of the internet provides us with information 
            gathered from various third-party sources. Phones for example, are able to provide us with information that is relevant 
            to our local area. This is achieved through communication with API clients whose goal is to distribute information in 
            various channels. As the name suggests, API is a command tool used to access the components which help us build software
            programs. They are the interconnected chains of computer systems that uses logical structures to achieve a certain 
            purpose. Imagine a toolbox full of cogwheels, each different in size and weight. Once they are arranged in relation to 
            each other, the cogwheels form a structure that is used to achieve a specified goal. “Web APIs has evolved in a rather
            autonomous way, which is perhaps one of the main reasons for their rapid proliferation. (Carlos.2010)” They are designed
            to work with each other and require little to no interference from human interaction. Web API’s are examined in terms 
            of their type and how many operations they facilitate. Furthermore, details about how information is transmitted are 
            useful to provide a description of the range of technologies the API has access to. When is come to user information 
            web API’s can be seen as gatekeepers, protecting our personal data and only handing it out to the technologies that we
            depend on most.
