        <h1>How the digital divide affects us</h1>

        <p> The digital divide came into fruition early in the 1990’s when it became apparent that not every individual possesses
            the capability to operate computer systems or has access to the internet. This led to an economic and social inequality
            that impacts the spread of information and communication technologies. For example, the divide within countries such as
            the United States may refer to the inequalities between households, individuals, businesses or geographic areas usually
            at different socio-economic levels or other demographic categories. This also suggests that the digital divide
            phenomenon is linked to new forms of technology that develops in a global sphere. The divide between different 
            countries or regions of the world is referred to as the global digital divide. This defines the technological gap in
            terms of access and usage to information between developing and developed countries on an internal scale. Additional
            factors such as income, education, geographic location, age and motivation further influences this divide.
