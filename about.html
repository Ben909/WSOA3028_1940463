<h3><font size = "6">Hello and Welcome, my name is Mark</font> 

</h3>
<p>
    Hello to all of you aspiring artists and web developers.
    My name is Mark and I welcome you to my corner of the internet.
    My lifelong passion has always been to visit surreal places around the world and create digital art pieces from my experiences.
    I have created this website to share some of my experiences with anybody who appreciates exotic locations. 
    Currently, I am a 58-year-old male living in Johannesburg, ready to embark on a journey of software development and pixel art construction. 
    My interest in pixel art came from my earlier life playing video games.
    Back in my day, video game engines were not able to produce the magnificent graphics we see today. 
    I am still curious as to how digital pixel art has led us to perceive information as we do today. 
    In the months ahead, I will extend my knowledge about computer software so that I can share my knowledge through my website.
    Join me as I delve in to the pixel art universe and uncover its mysteries.<br/>
    Below you can my first art work.
    This piece illustrates a mountain range in china and it would look like in a lower pixel resolution
