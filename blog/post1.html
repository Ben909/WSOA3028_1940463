        <h1>Internet Histories</h1>

        <p> Before the internet came into fruition, it was difficult to amass and store information in such a way that it could provide easy access to multiple interrelated subjects.
            It wasn’t until 15 years after the first computers were built that researchers conceptualized a network of interconnected computers that provides services which transcends the capabilities of a single system.
            This system ultimately forms the foundation of a new platform which encapsulates the history and future of all known research.
            The internet as we know it today, relates to the gathering of information throughout history.
            It continuously expands through the collection of data which enables humans to better understand the world around them.
            As a result, the Internet has become an amalgamation of libraries that entails the history of humankind.
            As Borges suggests, “the first librarians, employed a language quite different from the one we speak today”(Borges.1998).
            This relates to the idea that the internet constantly changes and adapts to the needs of its users.
            It would be difficult to imagine a world without the internet since it provides us with instant access to information on countless interrelated subjects that are available in various languages.
            What makes it even more accessible is the ability to communicate and share information on a global scale.
            It enables people to rapidly collect data and extend the knowledge which is already available. 
            The internet is now regarded to be a major force in the way society views and accesses information.</p>
