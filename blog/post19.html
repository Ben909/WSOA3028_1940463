        <h1>External Dependancy</h1>

        <p> When deciding on an external dependency, it is important to realize how it links back to elements of the website and the 
            character. These external dependencies can be defined as events that occur outside of our own projects. They affect the critical
            decisions that are made within our internal organizations. The travel and tourism industry for example, have an external 
            dependency that is linked to holiday periods. In terms of web development, external dependencies utilize an abundance of 
            tools that enable users to dynamically connect to resources that are relevant both inside and outside of the website. It is 
            important to realize how these dependent circumstances interact with various demographics in a meaningful way. 
        </p>    
        <p> For the purpose of my website, I had to consider how the contents of my character could interact with an API. The character I chose is an 
            aspiring journalist who also has a passion for fishing. With this in mind I added a dependency in the form of a Google map. 
            This allows the character to pinpoint specific locations with regard to news stories in the city. Furthermore, the map can also 
            be used by my character to mark popular fishing spots in and around the city of Johannesburg. Another main reason why I 
            implemented this API was because Google maps provides easy access to everyday users. The ‘share location’ button allows users to 
            create their own embedded map and link it directly to their website via the iframe tag. Alternative external dependencies 
            include social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook, that can provide users with an abundance of information regarding 
            topics that relate to their personal interest. These platforms help to improve connections between people and promote 
            conversations according to various ideologies. Though this API would be suitable for the purpose of my website, I was unable 
            to successfully implement the API without causing errors to my main webpage. The final decision was made to use Google maps 
            as an external dependency since the geographic location explores the concept of how the physical world is reflected through a digital lens.
