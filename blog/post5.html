        <h1>The Medium is the Message</h1>

        <p> Throughout the ages, we have always developed new ways to communicate information effectively across emerging platforms.
            Each medium is improved or built upon the characteristics of previous successful platforms.
            As a new medium comes into fruition, we become aware of the advantages and disadvantages or at least how it can change the way we normally do things.
            There are often unsuspected consequences in new technologies that implicate our society and culture.
            In these sudden changes, it is important to understand the extent to which technology alters our perception of messages and their meanings.
            Therefore, it can be argued that the message which results from the medium may be used to change the attitude of an audience and encourage them to take action.
            The technological advancements make it easy for multiple interactions to take place between communicative devices.
            Marshal McLuhan is of the opinion that the manner in which we send and receive information is more important than the contents of the information itself.
            Nowadays we are able to produce our own content based on the technology that we consume, for example, the contents of a television program can be shared or discussed anywhere around the world through social media platforms like Twitter or Facebook.
            It is evident that technology has and will continuously change the way we understand and interpret information.
            To a certain extent the ‘medium’ reorganizes our consciousness and how we consume messages, thus changing they way we view society itself.</p>
