        <h1>The fourth industrial revolution</h1>

        <p>In our first industrial age, steam powered mechanized production laid the foundation of large-scale distribution channels.
            Many year later we have developed new methods such as, computerized robots and software that are used for the production
            of far more complex goods. The fourth industrial revolution indicates that the development of technologies over the
            coming twenty years will drastically change life as we know it. It is crucial for nations to take advantage and engage
            with rapid changes in technology, especially in South-Africa. According to Sutherland, “4IR is not the result of   
            careful historical analysis, rather it is a ﬂag to rally and a rhetorical device for those trying to create particular
            economic and commercial futures, hoping to ride waves of Schumpeterian economic disruption caused by extreme 
            automation and extreme connectivity (REF)”. What we need is an educational system that extends our capability to 
            develop and adapt to new forms of creative technology. 
        </p>    
        <p> South Africa has the potential to embark on this journey, 
            however, the current economic state will prevent the majority of people from entering this sphere. The reasons are
            simple, we lack infrastructure and the policy frameworks to produce and compete with the quality of providers in 
            top tier nations. Furthermore, we shall require technological assistance and qualified educators that will help prepare
            us for the adoption of new technologies. Our country must first create the proper conditions for us to partake in this 
            new industrial age. We must reinvent the environment of business models and strategies that is necessary to complete with 
            global markets. The idea of dynamic capability provides the means to organize resources and manage expenditures in every 
            sector. Despite all this preparation, the initial economic impact would be negative as businesses will face many unforeseen challenges.
