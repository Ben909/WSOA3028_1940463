        <h2>The state of load shedding</h2>

        <p> The climate this year feels different somehow, like 2020 is preparing us for a series of unexpected events. 
            This isn’t helped by the face that Eskom, South-Africa’s main electricity provider assures the country that stage 8 load 
            shedding is not expected, but planned for. Many of us wonder what other plans they have in store for us. The public was
            notified that each stage provides a reduction in load capacity of approximately 5%, meaning that each 5% equates to about 
            1000 megawatts. This news comes from a supposedly ‘inaccurate’ source that warns municipalities to brace for the escalation 
            of level 8 blackouts. Eskom maintains that it is highly unlikely that we will ever reach such a point, but experts disagree.
            Last year, the rolling blackouts occurred mainly because Eskom had depleted its resources and the power grid could no longer
            maintain its core functionality. This had a severe impact on small businesses, rural areas and the province of Cape Town.
            Thankfully Eskom received a financial injection form the government to ease the immense pressure on the power grid. Eskom
            maintains that the electrical system was under heavy strain from a series of rain storms in the Mpumalanga province. The
            disruption of coal supply had engineers working on a system that could decrease the risk of losing power units 
            unexpectedly. We anxiously await further details on the matter.
