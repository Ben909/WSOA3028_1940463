        <h2>Creature in the Lake</h2>

        <p> I met a strange fellow at Westdene dam the other day. He introduced himself as Harold and boy was he eager to inform me about the
            mysteries of the lake. He came up to me just as I threw my lure deep into the lake. I told him it’s my first-time fishing here and
            then asked if he could give me any tips. He anxiously looked at the murky water before he said, “haven’t you heard about the
            Unagi’s curse?” Naturally I was curious to find out more about this strange creature. The man told me how the lake was cursed and
            that at night many fishermen have started to disappear once they hooked an Unagi. He explains that the Unagi are a species of
            prehistoric that destroyed the lakes eco system. They are ferocious predatory creatures with an appetite for almost anything,
            but mostly prefer meat. Unfortunately, my hook was baited with a piece of chicken liver, meant to attract catfish. I wasn’t 
            prepared for the events that followed. The line on my reel began to tighten as I felt the weight what felt like a cement bag
            at the end of my line. I’ve had many fishing battles in the past, but few as exhilarating and terrifying as this one. The 
            man saw I was struggling to maintain control over rod as it slowly dragged me close to the waters edge. Luckily, he gripped
            my arm just as I was about to be dragged into the water. “Cut the line!”, he exclaimed. But my fisherman instincts drove me to 
            uncover the identify of this mysterious monster. Suddenly the line came swimming straight at us, I quickly reeled in as much line as I 
            could. The stranger and I nervously looked at each other as bubbles began to surface right in front of us. Then the creature revealed 
            itself. Large yellow eyes on the side of its head with huge jagged teeth protruding from its mouth. Turns out the creature was in fact 
            an enormous alligator who clearly wasn’t impressed with my attempt to catch it. With one fell swoop he yanked the hook out of his mouth 
            and hissed at us. I felt a cold shiver go down my spine as I finally realised how other fisherman must’ve gone missing. Without any
            further hesitation Harold and I bolted up the hill, never turning back at the sound of footsteps behind us. Finally, the alligator
            lost interest as we neared the main road. I am all for fishing adventures, but these kinds of encounters are best left for people like
            Steve Irwin. It is now safe to say that I will never return to Westdene lake ever again.
