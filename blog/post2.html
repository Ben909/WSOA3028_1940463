        <h1>Important Moment in Internet Development</h1>

        <p> Since it first came into our lives, the internet has revolutionized the way we live and communicate.
            Up until the year 2004, people used Hotmail and Yahoo to send and receive digital information.
            These two email providers offered between 2 MB and 4 MB of storage space. 
            So, when google launched its own free online service, they announced users would be provided with 1 GB storage space (Laxton.2010) 
            This far exceeded the normal capacity of any other e-mail service at the time. 
            It meant that businesses could operate more efficiently and that they could keep track of the communication that took place between employees and other businesses. 
            It also supported an advertising webmail system which quickly became popular amongst most manufacturers. 
            This allows businesses to rapidly expand their connections with people around the world. 
            These advertisements have caused disaster in the majority of user inboxes. 
            It’s also the main cause of what is known as “email overload”[4] which relates to having emails with various status types. 
            Overload also suggest an excessive volume of incoming email about topics which are unrelated to its users. 
            Furthermore, personal user information could be accessed which caused further overload of spam mail. 
            One aspect that made G-mail more viable was its interconnectivity with other applications associated with google. 
            Establishing such links made any interrelated software more popular with users around the world.</p>
