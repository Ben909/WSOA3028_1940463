        <h2>Covid-19 strikes again</h2>

        <p> Recent reports indicate the spreading of a deadly new virus that is ravaging countries all over the world. 
            The World Health Organization declared the virus is now a global pandemic and asks countries to take the necessary 
            precautions. This is due to the volatile nature of the airborne virus which enables it to spread rapidly between people.
            The virus originated in China’s Hubei province via the infected wet markets. These markets sell exotic animals for human 
            consumption due to China’s excessive population. Additional research conducted by American investigators suggests the 
            virus originated in one of China’s laboratories, but these theories were debunked. Furthermore, president Cyril Ramaphosa
            declared that South-Africa will enter a state of national lockdown to prevent the virus from spreading. Members of 
            society must wear face mask and practice social distancing while outside their houses. Thus far, there is no cure for 
            this particular coronavirus and according to researchers, it may take up to a year or longer to develop a vaccine. The 
            United States, Spain and Italy are among the hardest hit countries of the coronavirus. Patients with previous medical 
            conditions are at high risk of succumbing to the virus.
