        <h1>Metaphor Design for User Interface</h1>

        <p> An interface metaphor is a set of user interface visuals, actions and procedures that exploit specific knowledge that users have previously gained from other websites.
            The purpose of the interface metaphor is to give the user knowledge in a simplistic format about how to interact with the user interface.
            They are designed to be similar to our own physical entities but also contain their own properties, for example, desktop metaphors and web portals.
            They can be based on an activity and object or a combination of both work with user’s knowledge to help them understand the unfamiliar.
            Examples of interface metaphors are the magnifying glasses that represent the “zoom in” function or folder icons to show where files are contained.
            These are used in most current operating systems; however, this technology is susceptible to change as computers become more advanced.
        </p>    
        <p> A down side to changing interface metaphors on a constant basis is that the owners of software with many users are reluctant to make big changes and their interfaces evolve permanently to keep their familiar look and familiarity.
            Software designers attempt to make applications easier to use for both novice and adept users by creating concrete metaphors that resemble the user’s real-world experiences.
            Continual technological improvement has made metaphors depict these real-world experiences more realistically to ultimately enhance interface performance.
