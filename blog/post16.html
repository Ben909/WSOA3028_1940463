        <h1>Metadata</h1>

        <p> The world wide web contains an amalgamation of data and information that grants global access to internet users. Metadata is a 
            way to identify some elements surrounding a piece of information, so that we have a better idea of what that information is. 
            The vast online collection of information constantly undergoes changes to improve their functionality in terms of how we 
            recognize and access source material. They require descriptive values to establish how information resources are managed online. 
            An example of metadata can be seen in libraries where books contain specific details about the authors, publishers and dates. The 
            fferent categories that books can fall into are prime examples of metadata. Given that a library’s primary task is helping others 
            find the information they are looking for, metadata makes it possible for librarians to accomplish this task. Search engines 
            operate under the same principle where different collections have different ways of being organized depending on the collections 
            purpose. The computer then takes that information about the source material and uses it to figure out what to do with the 
            information so that it can be found can reused later.
